## My portfolio for my front-end developer work

This is a portfolio that I build in HTML and CSS.

I built this because I am a new front-end developer out in the world and I wnanted somewhere to showcase my work, my capabilites and my passion for front-end development.

Buidling this static portfolio helped me gain understandign for simple but effective html and css layouts and how to present my projects.
